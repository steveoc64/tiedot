Keywords: Golang, go, document database, NoSQL, JSON


This is a simple fork of https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/tiedot, with mods to handle much smaller data files.

Data Block size reduced from 16M down to 512K.
HashTable size reduced from 8M to 256K

... thats all !!

### tiedot - Your NoSQL database powered by Golang

tiedot is a document database engine that uses __JSON__ as document notation; it has a powerful query processor that supports advanced set operations; it can be __embedded__ into your program, or run a stand-alone server using __HTTP__ for an API on most *nix and Windows operating systems.

tiedot has fault-tolerant data structures that put your data safety *first*, while considering scalability in design.

> Did you know? The largest known tiedot deployment powers a personal offline Wikipedia indexing project, it has 5.9 million documents and over 73GB of data.

### Project Story

__Is tiedot "yet another NoSQL database"?__

There are probably as many NoSQL database as there are Linux distributions.

tiedot is not as powerful (yet) - and does not intend to compete with mainstream NoSQL database engines such as CouchDB or Cassandra. However, tiedot performs reasonably well given its small size (around 3k LOC); and due to its simplicity, its performance may come close or even exceed those large brand NoSQL solutions (under certain workloads).

__What is the motive behind this project?__

Golang (Go) is a fascinating language - very easy to use, scalable and reasonably stable. I am very passionate about document database technologies (check out my other GitHub projects!) and enjoy seeing my code scaling well on SMP machines. This is my Golang exercise.

__Why the name "tiedot"?__

"tiedot" is a Finnish word standing for "data". I enjoy learning (natural and computer) languages, also enjoy listening to music in many languages. "Tiedot" sounds cute, doesn't it?
